        Form and track positive lasting habits
        <br/>

        <span style="text-align: center; font-size: medium;">built with ðŸ’œ by <a href="http://xenodium.com">me</a> and powered by <a href="https://orgmode.org">org</a>

    <h2>Why</h2>

    Keeping habits accessible and trackable has helped me form good habits. I built an app to remove friction from the tracking process, so I could increase the likelihood of sticking with it all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not a habits expert, but got inspired by James Clear's <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>. Read that book if you're interested in the topic. No affiliation here, just a great book.
    <h2>Friction</h2>
    Friction is one of the bad guys when it comes to adopting and sticking with habits. Same applies to tracking habits itself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I tried to make Flat Habits simple and focused (I use it myself). Marking habits should be quick and frictionless. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy">Don't break that chain</a>.
    <h2>Habits</h2>
    You can track any positive habit you'd like to form. Some examples: exercising, watering the plants, reading, making your bed, taking your meds, call grandma, yoga, drink water, meditate, push-ups, floz, take your vitamins, eat fruit, practice a language...
    <h2>Not a task manager</h2>
    Flat Habits focuses solely on re-enforcing positive habits. Their benefits compound over time, but only if you regularly put in the work. If you don't exercise frequently, you don't get the health and fitness benefits. If you don't water the plants, they die.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <span style="font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;">Don't let your todos compete and win over your habits</span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Keeping habits separate from my long list of todos has been helpful for me. Habits are the good things I must do for myself every day. No postponing allowed "because I have too many other things on my list".
    <h2>Privacy first</h2>
    Flat Habits stores your habit data on your iPhone as a plain text file (in <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org</a> format). You can view, edit, or migrate your data at any time (use export from the menu).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <span style="font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;">Flat Habit does not connect to any servers at all</span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Optionally, you can save your habits to a shared location or cloud (if that's your preference), so you can access habit data from multiple devices/apps. Some of us like to <a href="http://xenodium.com/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios">use our beloved text editors</a> (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) to poke at <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">org habits</a>.
    <h2>Get in touch</h2>
    User the feedback menu option from the app or email flathabits <span style="font-style: italic;">at</span> xenodium.com.
    <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
    No personal data is sent to any server, as there is no server component to this app. There are neither third party server integrations, accounts, analytics, advertising, nor hidden trackers in this app. All your data is kept on your iPhone, unless you choose a cloud provider to sync or store your data. See your cloud provider's privacy policy for details on how they may handle it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you choose to send feedback by email, you have the option to review and attach logs to help diagnose issues. If you'd like an email thread to be deleted, just ask.
