    <h2>Why an app?</h2>

    Keeping habits accessible and trackable has helped me form good habits. I built an app to remove friction from the tracking process, so I could increase the likelihood of sticking with it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not a habits expert, but got inspired by James Clear's <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>. Read that book if you're interested in the topic. No affiliation here, just a great book.
    <h2>Is tracking inconvenient?</h2>
    It's not. I tried to make the app simple and focused (I use it myself). Mark a habit done whenever you do it and <a href="https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy">don't break the chain</a>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's really encouraging to see your daily streaks grow. I really don't want to break mine.
    <h2>What kind of habits?</h2>
    Any positive habit you'd like to form like exercise, water the plants, read, make your bed, recycle, call grandma, yoga, cleaning, drink water, meditate, take a nap, make your lunch, journal, laundry, push-ups, floz, take your vitamins, take your meds, eat salad, eat fruit, practice a language, practice an instrument, go to bed early...
    <h2>Is this a todo app?</h2>
    Nope. This app focuses solely on re-enforcing positive habits. Habits must happen regularly for them to bring you real benefit. If you don't exercise regularly, you don't get the health benefits. If you don't water the plants, they die.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keeping habits separate from my long list of todos has been helpful for me. Keeping the activities separate helps compartmentalize habits vs todos. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Habits are the good things I must do for myself every day (no postponing allowed)</span>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are far too many todos in your list. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't let your todos compete and win over your habits</span>.
    <h2>Where is my data stored?</h2>
    On your iPhone as a plain text file (in <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org</a> format). You can view, edit, or migrate your data at any time (use export from the menu).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Optionally, you can save your habits to a shared location, so you can access them from multiple devices/apps. Some of us like to <a href="http://xenodium.com/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios">use our beloved text editors</a> (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) to poke at <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">org habits</a>.
    <h2>Got more questions?</h2>
    I may not have the answer, but I can try to answer. Email flathabits <span style="font-style: italic;">at</span> xenodium.com.
